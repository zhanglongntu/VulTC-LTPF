# VulTC-LTPF:Enhancing Long-Tailed Software Vulnerability Type Classification with Adaptive Data Augmentation and Prompt Tuning

This is the source code to the paper "VulTC-LTPF:Enhancing Long-Tailed Software Vulnerability Type Classification with Adaptive Data Augmentation and Prompt Tuning". Please refer to the paper for the experimental details.

## Approach

## About dataset.
Due to the large size of the datasets, we have stored them in Google Drive: [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P42XsDWeMqAW33oS0gGamXEqxYiMjO5i?usp=drive_link)

## Requirements
You can install the required dependency packages for our environment by using the following command: ``pip install - r requirements.txt``.

## Reproducing the experiments:

1.You can directly use the ``dataset`` we have processed: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P42XsDWeMqAW33oS0gGamXEqxYiMjO5i?usp=drive_link)

2.Run ``method/gress_train.py``. After running, you can retrain the ``model`` and obtain results.

3.You can find the implementation code for the ``RQ1-RQ5`` section and the ``Discussion`` section experiments in the corresponding folders. 

## About model.
You can obtain our ``saved model`` and reproduce our results through the link:[Model Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HXOfpJzSlkCPuPkoKBkMjWRhpMKnOqiL/view?usp=sharing).
